<h5>The log for V0.6.0.</h5>
<p>
    <b>Target of this version is to extend the calls and configurations for database access.
        Actually they just execute static configurations in
     ==>{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EODBR||DbSqlConfig.json}.</b>

    Another point of the discussion was the embedding directives in the <a href="/examples/TemplateCall.html">Templates</a>.
</p>
<p>Here I used some attribute pattern parsing $[path] for paths
    or $[(call)path key1="value1" key2="value2"... keyN="valueN"] for calls.</p>
<p>
    But one just have to integrate JSON in
    some arbitrary text.
    Since we use JSON I put some curly brackets around. </p>
<p>
    The end pattern is a dot outside the bracket. If the markup has content, it will set by a pipe.
</p>
<p>
    To emphasize the directive I put a [=][=]=> before. Every whitespace before this pattern will be ignored,
    to make the template more readable.
</p>
<p>
    A path value now will be set by =&gt;{path}.
</p>
<p>
    A JSON part will be embedded by
    ===&gt;{JSON}. or
    ===&gt;{JSON}|content=>{}.,
    where content could be set for calls implementing
    ==>{GithubLinkCall->ModelConfig, CallContent}.
</p>
<p>Here any combination of typed json could be set. If several calls are within, the content will set to the last call will set to</p>
<p>
    As a short version of the JSON with one call there is the possibility to use the pattern
    ==&gt;{Call->value1, value2, ..., valueN}. and
    ==&gt;{Call->value1, value2, ..., valueN}| ..content..=&gt;{}. for calls with content.
</p>
<p>
    This shorthand version is similar to the attribute version and simplify the usage for simple calls like
    the often used ==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, CallContent}.:
    <textarea>==&gt;{GithubLinkCall->ModelConfig, CallLoop}.</textarea>

    Yesterday I had some discussion and a little presentation in the company I worked before.
    As expected GraphQL was mentioned. During the refinement of the database part there will one or the other
    topic will emerge.
</p>
<p>
    The presentation struggled with packing too much in a short time. The basic questions emerged I try to answer
    with
    the two applications I develop on top of EO and too complex combined examples.
</p>
<p>
    As a conclusion I've realized I has to put some work in documentation. As a start I've tried to describe
    the two <a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjects.org">applications</a>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjectsOrg.html">elasticobjects.org</a></li>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationBuilder.html">code builder</a></li>
</ul>

    Finished V0.5.0 and deployed it.
