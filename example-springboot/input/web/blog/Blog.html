<h5>The log for V0.6.0.</h5>
<p>
    <b>Target of this version is to extend the calls and configuratons for database access.
        Actually they just execute static configurations in
    $[(GithubLinkCall)EODBR||DbSqlConfig.json configType="NONE" /]</b>

    Yesterday I had some discussion and a little presentation in the company I worked before.
    As expected GraphQL was mentioned. During the refinement of the database part there will one or the other
    topic will emerge.
</p>
<p>
    The presentation struggled with packing too much in a short time. The basic questions emerged I try to answer
    with
    the two applications I develop on top of EO and too complex combined examples.
</p>
<p>
    As a conclusion I've realized I has to put some work in documentation. As a start I've tried to describe
    the two <a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjects.org">applications</a>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjectsOrg.html">elasticobjects.org</a></li>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationBuilder.html">code builder</a></li>
</ul>
