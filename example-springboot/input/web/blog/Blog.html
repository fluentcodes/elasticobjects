<h5>The log for V0.7.0.</h5>
<p>
    <b>Target of this version is to extend the calls and configurations for database access.
        Actually they just execute static configurations in
     ==>{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EODBR||DbSqlConfig.json}.</b>
</p>
<p align="right"><i>2.11.2020</i></p>
<p>
    Refactoring the sql configuration part with
    <ul>
    <li>==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbSqlReadCall}. which could be parametrized</li>
    <li>==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbSqlExecuteCall}.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    The implementation of database objects with
    ==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, ModelConfigDbObject}. allows to define generic calls with objects.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbModelReadCall}. </li>
    <li>==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbModelWriteCall}. </li>
    <li>==>{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbModelDeleteCall}. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    With this the model configuration could contain permissions or special table names like in
    ==>{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EOTR||ModelConfig.json}.
</p>
<p>The database module
    should show just the possibilities of the concept: One or several databases could be easily integrated
    in a generic way. So it's more a "proof of concept" and has no library on
    <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.fluentcodes.projects.elasticobjects">mvn central</a>.
</p>
<p>
    What's missing is a object mapping for the request results or a generation of databases.
    Such features could be integrated with a hibernate module that is in the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
    But productiveness of any database module will need some real projects to fix all potential problems.

<p>
    Finished the templates and decides to publish it as <a href="BlogV0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.html">0.7.0-SNAPSHOT</a>, since a central component interface for
    controlling. is changed.
