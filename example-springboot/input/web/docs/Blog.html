<h3>17.9.2020</h3>

<p>Yesterday I've published the version 0.3.0 
    with the first generated json configurations from 
    some streamlined excel. </p>
<p>
    With 0.3.0 the different configuration types e.g. for database access or Excel sheets 
    are removed introducing a configModelKey as a field. So one just have 
    the following configurations:
</p>
<ul>

        <li>ModelConfig</li>
        <li>FieldConfig</li>
        <li>HostConfig</li>
        <li>FileConfig</li>
        <li>DbSqlConfig</li>
</ul>

<p>With 0.4.0 the the structure of the configuration with different immutable 
    sub classes will be stream lined. This is some kind of over modelling but originally 
    comes from the idea to make the configuration immutable. 
</p>
<p>
    Another reason was to divide the properties to some kind of purpose. Length was 
    for example is a property used in database. But one can also use it in the set methods of
    the field. So a clean division is not generally given. 
</p>
    <p>Since there is no general valid 
    purpose of the properties, I will put it into one property map beside 
    those properties which are helpful for editing with filters. 
</p>
<p>
    Another reason is that when generating configurations or classes it depends 
    on the architectur you need additional properties. This could be e.g. 
    endpoints for the web interface or some xml names. So a general purpose generator 
    could not have some kind of fixed properties. It must be adaptable to 
    the target framework/programming language. 
</p>
<p>
    This general filter purpose fields will be e.g. module. I think length i
    also a useful general valid information for filtering directly.
</p>

<p>
    There are some nice feature with Java 8 and default methods to get the property 
values with get/set methods. 
</p>
<p>
    With the move to the properties map I wanted to use some immutable 
    maps and lists since its configurations which should not be changed by 
    some mistake. 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately the java8 unmodifiable List and Map in Colletions have some side effects, that all lists/map will have the same value.
    strange behaviour where the package path property is the same for all models with a collapse of all. 
    I couldn't get deep into. It would be a topic of the sandbox. </p>

<p>I took a look in the guava library with its immutable map and lists,
even it's general purpose huge with about 2,8 MB which would extend the size 
of the example-spring jar file even more. </p>
<p>
    But to use "ImmutableMap" the rather simple map/list models have to 
    be extended since Guava use an implementation from the scratch.
</p>
<p>Actually I don't want to move to java9, where immutable maps 
are provided out of the box. Since it's a library all users have to move to java8. 
    I go back from Java 11 to java 8 since the deployment to google cloud 
    complains that only java 8 will supported. 
</p>
<p>
    So I decided continue with the simple LinkedHashMap in 0.4.0. Think there will 
    be hopefully a simple solution to avoid accidentally changing configurations.
