<h3>Lean Services</h3>
<p>
    Today's web service architecture use web endpoints to determine
<ul>
    <li>the structure of object(s) and </li>
    <li>function.</li>
</ul>
via method call approach.
</p>

<h4>Shopping List Parable</h4>
<p>
    To tie web endpoints to object structure and functionality is not obvious, more a thing of IT history.
    It comes to communication pattern one would never accept in real live.
</p>
<p>
    Given you have a good restaurant and someone to buy the things you need fresh from the market.
    Your employee would act that way:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>drive to market...
        <ul><li>buy 20 kg flour from marketeer1</li>
            <li>driving to the restaurant</li>
            <li>store it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>drive to market...
        <ul><li>buy 20kg tomatoes from fruit marketeer</li>
            <li>drive back to the restaurant</li>
            <li>store it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>drive to market...
        <ul><li>buy 5 kg mozarella, 2 kg parmesan from cheese marketeer</li>
            <li>drive back to the restaurant</li>
            <li>store it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the car could be broken or the shop is closed or an accident happens or traffic jam one build some kind of
observation system to inform you about these events.</p>
<p>
    If you ask your employee how one can improve this task,
    he would offer you a compound services. But he needs five day to learn the new route.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>drive to market...
        <ul><li>buy 12 kg flour from marketeer1, buy 30kg tomatoes from fruit marketeer, buy 3 kg mozarella, 6 kg parmesan from cheese marketeer</li>
            <li>drive back to the restaurant</li>
            <li>store it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
    That looks better but it's tied to a certain combination.
</p>
    <p>
    And if you need a new chair or flowers or decoration your employee need ten days to learn.
    </p>
<p>
    As the owner of the restaurant you would fire your employee.
    But since every candidate works in the same way, there is no
    alternative. They claim it's the state of the art with no alternative. And they sacrify the word API for this.
</p>
<p>And they claim they need at least a new car. </p>

<h4>Communication Concept</h4>
<p>
    To come to a conclusion. ElasticObjects implements something where object structure and functionality is bound
    to a field. I think this is rather straightforward and obvious. And offer much more flexiblity.
</p>
<p>
    To create some pseudo request for the shopping list:
    <textarea style="height:220px">{
  "basket": [],
  "(BuyCall)1": {
        "targetPath":"basket",
        "product":"tomatoes",
        "amount":5,
        "shop":"fruit marketeer"
   },
  "(BuyCall)2": {
        "targetPath":"basket",
        "product":"cheese",
        "amount":30,
        "shop":"fruit marketeer"
   },
  "(BuyCall)3": {
        "targetPath":"basket",
        "product":"flour",
        "amount":20,
        "shop":"fruit marketeer"
   }
}
    </textarea>
<p>
    This call isn't implemented yet, but it will easy to make the request work, since it a simple Java bean
    with an execute method which can be used in any context.
</p>

<p>
    With this approach the combination of what to be done is free. The JSON send is a compound object
    filled by the calls in a way, the client decide.
    There is no need to implement something
    for each combination. And one can test it without web server, since the web server
    just send and receive messages. Nothing else.
</p>
<p>
    If you need new product from a new shop it's just a new call.
    So thats the basic idea.
</p>
<p>
    As with every parable the comparision lags. The products mean all possible methods a server would like to offer.
    This could be the <a href="examples/TheGreetingCall.html">GreetingCall</a> or
    the computation of a <a href="/config/ModelConfig/SinusValueCall?configFilter=.*Call">&ocir;sinus</a>
    or a database request.
</p>

<h4>Templates</h4>
<p>
    One could embed arbitrary calls in a text context with templates calls. This give more flexibility
    than a batch call with JSON. If the content is not
    relevant, this is a process engine.
</p>
<p>
    These templates are a call itself, so you are free to combine data operation and rendering even in the content.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    EO interprets 2 simple straightforward extensions of JSON to
    trigger bean calls.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>object mapping before field name with brackets</li>
    <li>fields with _ will not mapped to the parent</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The basic implementation includes template execution and is open source. It's really small,
    so it could use just beside existing solution.
</p>
<p>
    EO does not implement something like the <a href="https://www.leanservices.info/">leanservices</a> which
    comes from the SOA context.

    And one could define special objects on the server side defining functionality working with informations of the whole message.
</p>

<p>
So this approach independent of the technologies like SOAP or REST is rather
lot of things has to be done on server side and the interface becomes more and more complex and each
service has to be tested that it's working as expected with each test starting a whole application server with incredible complex frameworks.
</p>
<p>
Most web service use SOAP or REST to standardize their interfaces.
    Both use the web-endpoint to define <b>type</b> and <b>function</b>. Since most web frameworks offer a broad palette
    do the request/response mapping or create target objects, so only the method has to be filled with it's functionality.
    In REST with it's restricted scope even the method could be created e.g. by spring boot.
</p>
<p>
    A JSON web service just say something about the format to exchange information. Everything has to be implemented on
both sides. Information about the endpoints and structure could be generated by tools like swagger. Webservices like
commercetool use such free JSON endpoint. The JSON content contains information about the function.
</p>
<p>
    SOAP has no restriction about functions.
    To inform the client about the endpoints and automate the creation of a sceleton SOAP uses WSDL. For object definition
    one has the xml scheme files to create these objects for example with JAXB.
</p>
<p>
    REST is a rather academic definition with a rather focused approach, specially in RESTful services with a simple CRUD
    (create read update delete) to http methods.
