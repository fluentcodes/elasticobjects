<h3>Planned</h3>
<p>
    With version 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 a complete refactoring of the java core EO has now a stable state, so I don't expect a deep
    refactoring of the core classes. The implementation is rather straightforward.
</p>
<p>
    Beside the cleanup with version 0.3.0 the following is planned:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>A stripped javascript version</li>
    <li>A JSON schema call for model configurations</li>
    <li>A JSON schema use within the EO wrapper</li>
</ul>
