        <p>No, unfortunately not. The architecture of EO put the type configurations in the heart of a solution. EO is a tiny skin, the underlying objects the sceleton and the transferable confgurations the muscles.  <br/><br/>With this archtecture one could abstract the differences and philosophies of different programming languages. <br/>Standards like JSONApi uses the trivial javascript types. In EO one can define e.g. the java types used by the server and a javascript counterpart translate this in javascripts type world. <br/><br/>But every typed language has it's weeknesses. Even in Java with it's 1001 class types a String field does not know it's length. So every framework solution for database access have this value in it's bag.<br/>Furthermore it has some inherent rules for the special type Calls and fieldnames not mapped to the parent object. <br/>But this simple rules and extensions allows a simple and practical way to build solutions.  </p>
