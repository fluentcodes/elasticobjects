<h3>Why field configurations have separate files?</h3>
<p>The fields are independent of the model.
        In scheme definitions this is also possible.
</p>
<p>
        One can reuse <a href="/configs/FieldConfig.html">field configuration</a>
        in  <a href="/configs/ModelConfig.html">model configuration</a>  only by its field name.
        So one field name has exactly one definition.
        One avoid different field definitions for the same field name in different models.
</p>
<p>The EOConfigCache initially load every file named FieldConfig.json from the class path and
        then resolve the field names in the model configurations by the field configurations.
</p>
<p>
        When the class names within Models.json are resolved,
        the field entries will be created via reflection using the combination &lt;ClassName> .&lt;FieldName> as naturalId.
