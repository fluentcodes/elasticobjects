        <p> EO encapsulate the differences in structured objects via path methods. It allow to embed objects with (type) rules at any place. With this generic approach the generic execute method in calls could be implemented. <br/><br/>At the end it's just a wrapper which could wrap any object: <br/><textarea>EO eoRoot = new EoRoot(cache, anObject);</textarea><textarea>eoRoot.set(otherObject, "aPath");</textarea></p>
