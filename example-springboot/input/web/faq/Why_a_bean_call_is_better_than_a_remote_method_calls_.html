        <p>Why an object is better than a method? <br/><br/>An object has instance vars which will be shown in a configuration and set when instantiated. With inheritance the implementation of a simple call is just an implementation of the execute method, since it's super class provide all necessary field variables. <br/><br/>A method has just a list of arbitrary input values. Each new requirement needs a new method, new DTO objects, new endpoint or new versions. </p>
