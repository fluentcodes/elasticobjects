        <h3>Why the field configurations are in separate files?</h3>
        <p>The fields are independent of the model. In scheme definitions this is also possible.<br/><br/>One can reuse <a href="/configs/FieldConfig.html">field configuration</a> in models only by its field name. So one field name has exactly one definition. One avoid different field definitions for the same field name in different models.<br/><br/>The EOConfigCache initially load every file named FieldConfig.json from the class path and then resolve the field names in the model configurations by the field configurations.<br/><br/>When the class names within Models.json are resolved, the field entries will be created via reflection using the combination &lt;ClassName> .&lt;FieldName> as naturalId. </p>
