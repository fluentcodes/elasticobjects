        <h3>Why the fields are defined in separate configuration files?</h3>
        <p>The fields are explicit independently of the model. In scheme definitions this is also possible.<br/><br/>So in model only the name of the field is important. One field name has exactly one definition. One avoid different field definitions for the same field name in different models.</p>
