<p>ElasticObjects is a Framework to build core applications by configurations. </p>
<p>Core of the framework are linked container objects, called <a href="adapter">Adapter</a>. Each <a href="adapter">Adapter</a>
    uses <a href="model">ModelCache</a> objects for object acces, initial loaded from JSON configurations within the
    classpath. </p>
<p>Several generic actions are implemented using other configuration JSON files in the classpath. The generic actions
    use also <a href="config">cached</a> configurations, e.g. for database access via hibernate. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s written in Java, but the concept is independent of a specific language. An implementation in a non class
    approach language like JavaScript could save the <a href="template">class generation part</a> and simplify the
    mapping to the <a href="adapter">Adapter</a>. </p>

<h4>A service example</h4>
<p>One of the goals is a service interface as powerful as SOAP without its complexity and verbosity. And the interface
    should be independent to some webserver like REST. </p>
<p>Compare with a dumb HATEOS-REST solution a client could get all configurations available on the server to create
    requests and handle responses including typesafety or database constraints.</p>
<h5>Request-JSON</h5>
<p>The request is in JSON format consists of some data and some actions calling serverside methods reference by the
    actionKey. </p>
<p>The following request call a read method on a h2 hibernate database with table BasicTest. It filter all entries,
    where testString has the value &#8220;testString3&#8221;. The result should be stored in the path &#8220;/test&#8221;. </p>
<pre>{
  ".actions": [
    {
      "actionKey": "HibernateModelAction.read(h2:mem:BasicTest)",
      "attributes": {
        "where": "testString eq testString3"
      "path": "test"
      }
    }
  ]
}</pre>
<h5>Response-JSON</h5>
<p>The response is filled with result from the database. The info field of the call is filled and furter log
    informations, when asked for.</p>
<pre>{
  ".data":
  {
    "test":
    [
      {
        ".models":"BasicTest",
        "id":3,
        "testInt":3,
        "testString":"testString3",
        "testLong":3,
        "testDate":1514934000000,
        "testFloat":3.1,
        "testDouble":3.2
      }
    ]
  },
  ".actions":
  [
    {
      ".models":"ActionBuilder",
      "actionKey":"HibernateModelAction.read(h2:mem:BasicTest)",
      "path": "test"
      "attributes":
      {
        ".models":"Map",
        "where":"testString eq testString3"
      },
      "info":"executed within 100 ms."
     }
  ]
}

<h4>State</h4>
<p>Actually the service approach is a working proof of concept. It&#8217;s comparable small to its power. Even it has
    almost 1000 tests one can easily create 1000 more due to its range of application.</p>
<p>For the service application field some project experience is needed to make it bullet proofed.</p>
<p>Anyhow the code generation or for data mash things are fields of applications which could save a lot of developing
    time.</p>
<p>In february I plan to deploy demo application and to push the sources to <a href="https://gitlab.com/fluentcodes/">Gitlab</a>.
</p>
<h4>Reasons</h4>
<h5>Code Generation</h5>
<p>I&#8217;ve started ElasticObjects almost six years ago, when working on a portfolio management project with more than
    100 tables and 1500 fields with a relation depth of seven and GBytes of data loaded every nicght from the host. A
    differential import should be implemented to reduce downtimes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created two excelsheet with table data and fields with all the database/hibernate and xml serialization
    informations including natural ids, since the id is not delivered by the host. Based on these schema informations,
    we created Java/SQL/Test and documentation via a simple template mechanism.</p>
<p>At the end we reduced the down time for uploading data from 6 hours to half an hour. I was fascinated saving so much
    time and effort creating Java solutions by a simple extraction of the model structure.</p>
<h5>Transportable Service Information</h5>
<p>My next project was a Human Resource Management solution. Here a part should refactored with hibernate and JQuery. It
    had a rather complex access and workflow logic.</p>
<p>During the realization I wished to have the information of the server within the client solution to avoid developing
    things twice. This was the start of ElasticObjects.</p>
