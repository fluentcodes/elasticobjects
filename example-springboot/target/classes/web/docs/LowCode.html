<h3>Low Code</h3>
<p>
The originally intention when starting this project was generating code from list information via templates.
    It had a cli interface to control the creation and used in projects I worked with.
</p>
<p>
    With version 0.5.0 there is a new version of the code generation tool with some template examples.
